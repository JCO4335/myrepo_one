<p>
   Born on March 30th, 1853, Vincent Van Gogh is a universally well-known Dutch painter
   who specialized in the style of post-impressionalism. He is responsible for famous paintings
   such as <i>Almond Blossoms</i>(1890), <i>Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers</i>(1888), 
   and <i>The Starry Night</i>(1889). While his first passion was wokring as a missionary,
   in Belgium, he quickly developed an immense love for art. At the age of 33 (1886), Van Gogh moved
   to Paris, France to begin his profession as an artist.

    it should automatically apply here, unless it's overridden.--> 
<p>
    <i>The Starry Night</i> by Vincent Van Gogh is considered on of the most famous
    paintings of all time. Painted in 1889, Van Gogh moved to the south of France
    as he was stressed from the environment of Paris. Unfortunately, Van Gogh's life
    was riddled with mental health issues and instability. It got to the point where
    he suffered from mental breakdowns and committed acts of self-harm (such as mutilating his left ear). 
    He spent time in numerous asylums/psychiatric hospitals. Specifically, he spent
    time at the <strong>Saint-Paul-de-Masuole</strong> monastery. In this monastery, it
    is confirmed that <i>The Starry Night</i> was inspired by the outside view
    from his bedroom in the asylum. Many interpret the painting as the epitome of Van Gogh's
    mental stuggles and melancholic perspective. In uncovered letters written by Van Gogh, he was not
    satisfied by the painting and saw it as a failed project. Vincent Van Gogh continued to
    struggled until he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1890.

<!-- Modify colors, fonts, text size, etc. in your external or internal CSS.
    Observe how the CSS cascade and inheritance affect these paragraphs
    vs. any inline-styled elements.-->

  <!--
    TODO #4 (Demonstrate Cascade):
      For example, if your external CSS sets a color on <h1>,
      and your internal CSS sets a different color, see which one wins.
      Add a short comment explaining the result according to Chapter 5
      on the CSS cascade.
