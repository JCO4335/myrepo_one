<h1>The Story Behind "The Starry Night" by Vincent Van Gogh</h1>
<p>
   Born on March 30th, 1853, Vincent Van Gogh is a universally well-known Dutch painter
   who specialized in the style of post-impressionalism. He is responsible for famous paintings
   such as <i>Almond Blossoms</i>(1890), <i>Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers</i>(1888), 
   and <i>The Starry Night</i>(1889). While his first passion was wokring as a missionary,
   in Belgium, he quickly developed an immense love for art. At the age of 33 (1886), Van Gogh moved
   to Paris, France to begin his profession as an artist.

    This paragraph should demonstrate <strong>inheritance</strong>.
    If you set a 'color' or 'font-family' on the <body> or a parent element,
    it should automatically apply here, unless it's overridden.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>The Starry Night</i> by Vincent Van Gogh is considered on of the most famous
    paintings of all time. Painted in 1889

    Modify colors, fonts, text size, etc. in your external or internal CSS.
    Observe how the CSS cascade and inheritance affect these paragraphs
    vs. any inline-styled elements.
  </p>

  <!--
    TODO #4 (Demonstrate Cascade):
      For example, if your external CSS sets a color on <h1>,
      and your internal CSS sets a different color, see which one wins.
      Add a short comment explaining the result according to Chapter 5
      on the CSS cascade.
